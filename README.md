# Install Wordpress Using Dokku

Setup a Wordpress app using Dokku and any system (not just a 5$ droplet as the original used to say).

## How to use this package

It is worth noting that this setup uses the wordpress convention of moving the core wordpress stuff to it's own directory so we can use it as a dependency.

You don't really need to tinker much with the file system but here's a little breakdown:

```
public
  ├─ uploads        # wordpress uploads folder
  ├─ wordpress      # wordpress core
  ├─ wp-content     # for wordpress plugins and theme customizations
  ├─ index.php      # slightly modified index.php from wordpress
  └─ wp-config.php  # modified wordpress configuration
vendor              # contains composer dependencies
.gitignore          # some very basic list of files to ignore
composer.json       # recipe for our app
nginx.conf          # see nginx.conf section below
Procfile            # see Procfile section
README.md           # you are here
```

#### 1. [Create a droplet](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new) on digitalocean 

**ALTERNATIVELY: just make sure you have composer installed on your local machine and have dokku running on your deployment server/machine**

- Choose an image - Dokku v0.4.12 on 14.04 (at the time of writing)
- Choose a size - $5/mo
- Choose a datacenter region - Region closest to your target audience
- Select additional options
  - Private Networking - optional
  - Backups - optional
  - IPv6 - optional
  - User Data - optional
- Add your SSH keys
  - [How To Use SSH Keys with DigitalOcean Droplets](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ssh-keys-with-digitalocean-droplets)
- Finalize and Create
  - How many droplets? - optional (1 will suffice)
  - Choose a hostname - optional

#### 2. Install Composer

Grab the installer [here](https://getcomposer.org/download/) according to your system and install as per instructions on their website.

_* The succeeding instructions assume that `composer.phar` is executable globally. Mine resides in `/usr/local/bin/composer`_

#### 3. Download and setup the dokku-wordpress package

- Download the package at [https://github.com/jubalm/do-dokku-wordpress/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/jubalm/do-dokku-wordpress/archive/master.zip) and extract to your project folder.
- Fire up the terminal and navigate to your project folder
- Run the following command (remember I renamed my composer executable)
  ```
  composer install
  ```
- Once completed, you will find a `composer.lock` file.

#### 4. Create the project repository

_* This assumes [git](https://git-scm.com) is installed on your system_

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'init'
```

Of course, the commit message on `-m` can be anything.

#### 5. Deploy

As dokku is pretty much similar to heroku, you can deploy your app by simply pushing a git commit to your dokku instance.

```
git remote add dokkuserv dokku@HOSTNAME:wordpress
git push dokkuserv master
```

Breakdown of the codes above

- `dokkuserv` is the remote repository alias
- `dokku` is the default username for the dokku instance
- `HOSTNAME` should be your digitalocean hostname
- `wordpress` will be the dokku app (container) that will be created

When the push completes, you'll see dokku does it's magic building your app. The log should look like

       http://wordpress.yourdomain.com
```

#### 6. Setup the database

Fist we need to install the mariadb plugin on our dokku instance to create our database.

Login to your instance using ssh and run the following.

```
dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-mariadb.git mariadb
dokku mariadb:create wpdb
```

Once done, let's link our database to our wordpress container

```
dokku mariadb:link wpdb wordpress
```

- `mariadb:link` is a dokku plugin command to link our database
- `wpdb` is the name of the database we just created
- `wordpress` simply provides the name of our app

#### 7. Setup Domain name

Nows a good time to setup the wordpress domain name.

```
dokku domains:add wordpress wordpress.yourdomain.com
```

- `domains:add` is a dokku plugin that adds a domain name to our app
- `wordpress` is the name of our app
- `wordpress.yourdomain.com` is the domain name

Our wordpress container also needs an environment variable `DOMAIN_NAME` to setup wordpress specific urls.

```
dokku config:add wordpress DOMAIN_NAME=wordpress.yourdomain.com
```

Now visit your blog from the domain name you provided and you will be redirected to the wordpress install page.

#### 8. Setup a storage volume for files

As configured it is impossible to make uploads, themes, plugins,... persistent. The easiest way to overcome this is to mount a local folder as a storage volume.

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/dokku/data/storage/wordpress/public
sudo chown -R dokku:dokku /var/lib/dokku/data/storage/wordpress/
sudo chown -R 32767:32767 /var/lib/dokku/data/storage/wordpress/
dokku storage:mount wordpress /var/lib/dokku/data/storage/wordpress/public/:/app/public/
```

- `/var/lib/dokku/data/storage/wordpress/` is an application specific folder for this application generated by dokku
- `/var/lib/dokku/data/storage/wordpress/public` is a data folder inside of your app specific folder
- `wordpress` is the name of our app
- `/app/public/` is the the directory in your container where /opt/wordpress/data gets mounted

For this to work, you need to rebuild the app

```
dokku ps:rebuild wordpress
```

#### 9. Allowing bigger files to be uploaded to Wordpress

By default this the application is configured to allow 50MB posts. However, the default Nginx installation used by Dokku for routing, only supports 1MB uploads. This must be set by you.

```
sudo echo 'client_max_body_size 50M;' > /home/dokku/wordpress/nginx.conf.d/upload.conf
sudo chown -R dokku:dokku /home/dokku/wordpress/nginx.conf.d/upload.conf
sudo service nginx reload
```

- `wordpres` is the name of your dokku application
- `50M` is the maximum upload size you want to allow for this application

In case you want to increase this size, you need to customize it in 3 places:

- `/home/dokku/wordpress/nginx.conf.d/upload.conf` as mentioned above
- In the `nginx.conf` that's in this repository `client_max_body_size 50M;`
- In `php.ini`, both `upload_max_filesize = 50M` and `post_max_size = 50M`

When you changed the size in these 3 places, repush the repository to dokku:

`git add nginx.conf php.ini && git commit -m 'change upload size' && git push dokkuserv master`

## Further Customization

You can find valuable resouce on dokku's website on how these configurations work.

#### Procfile

This basically sets up commands upon starting your app. You can find more information about this file [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile) and setting up php [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-php-settings)

```
web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-nginx -C nginx.conf public/
```

These mean:

  - `vendor/bin/heroku-php-nginx` use nginx as our web server
  - `-C nginx.conf` add the contents of `nginx.conf` to the nginx configuration
  - `public/` serve the website from the `public/` directory

#### nginx.conf

These are very basic configuration for your nginx server. More info can be found [here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Nginx).
